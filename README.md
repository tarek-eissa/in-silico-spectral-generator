# *in silico* spectral-generator

## Description

This repository contains a toolbox for the in silico model described in the paper entitled "**Limits and prospects of molecular fingerprinting for
phenotyping biological systems revealed through in silico modeling**".

The scripts, along with the provided datasets, allow for convenient applications of the described model to reproduce and extend the results presented in the paper.

The toolbox is fully built using the Python3 language with custom scripts, supported by commonly-used Python packages.


Python language
